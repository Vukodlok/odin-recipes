Practice html from The Odin Projec

DESCRIPTION
###############
This is a practice html file made during The Odin Project, a program for learning web development.  I know some basic html, css, and Javascript already, but hoped to learn more about JSON in the process.

I have not used Github before and am Starting to learn more about it through these projects.

I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out why I could edit my readme file but not my index file.  Turns out I need to use ctrl+c, then i to active insert mode so I can type in the html file.
